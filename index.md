Hi, I'm Hao-Yung Weng, a Master's in Machine Learning (MSML) student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)'s School of Computer Science. My research interests focus on natural language and speech processing, as well as large language models. Lately, I've been particularly fascinated by the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, and I'm also eager to learn more about the field of LLM alignment.

Before joining CMU, I graduated *summa cum laude* (top 1%) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) with a B.S. in Computer Science. While there, I had the privilege of working with Professor [Yun-Nung Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) on natural language processing and transfer learning, and with Professor [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php) on [speech processing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02122).

I've also gained a range of industry experience. At Google, as part of the gBMC team, I developed a bug triage system to streamline collaboration with vendors adapting the Joint Development Manufacturer (JDM) model. At WorldQuant, I built mathematical models to predict equity market movements using their internal platform.

In 2023, I was honored as one of Taiwan's Outstanding Youth.

Outside of my academic work, I'm a passionate coffee enthusiast and write [blog posts](https://whycoffee.blog) exploring the technical and scientific sides of coffee brewing.
