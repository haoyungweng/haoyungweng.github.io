hi, i'm hao-yung weng (翁浩永), a master's in [machine learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) (msml) student at [carnegie mellon university's school of computer science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). my research interests focus on natural language and speech processing, as well as large language models. lately, i’ve been fascinated by the mechanistic interpretability of llms and its applications in aligning and ensuring the safety of future ai.

before joining cmu, i graduated *summa cum laude* (top 1%) from [national taiwan university](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) with a bachelor's degree in computer science. while there, i had the privilege of working with professor [yun-nung chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) on natural language processing and transfer learning, and with professor [hung-yi lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php) on [speech processing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02122).

i've also gained a range of industry experience. at [google](https://about.google/), as part of the gbmc team, i developed a bug triage system to streamline collaboration with vendors under the joint development manufacturer model. at [worldquant](https://www.worldquant.com/), as a quantitative research intern, i built mathematical models to predict equity market movements and execute trades in the u.s. stock market based on those predictions.

in 2023, i was honored as one of taiwan's outstanding youth by the ministry of education.

outside of my academic work, i'm a passionate coffee geek and write [blog posts](https://whycoffee.blog/en) exploring the technical and scientific sides of coffee brewing.

cheers!
